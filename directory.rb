#5. Our code only works with the student name and cohort. Add more information: hobbies, country of birth, height, etc.
#6. Research how the method center() of the String class works. Use it in your code to make the output beautifully aligned.
#7. In the input_students method the cohort value is hard-coded. How can you ask for both the name and the cohort?
#7. What if one of the values is empty? Can you supply a default value?
